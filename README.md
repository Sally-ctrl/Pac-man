# Pac-Man Clone (JavaScript)

A simple Pac-Man clone built using **HTML5 Canvas** and **JavaScript**.

## 🎮 Features
- Classic Pac-Man movement with grid snapping  
- Ghost enemies that chase Pac-Man  
- Walls and pellets (coins) on a tile-based map

## 🛠️ Technologies
- **HTML5 Canvas** – rendering the game board and characters  
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – core game logic, movement, and collisions  
- **CSS** – simple styling for layout
